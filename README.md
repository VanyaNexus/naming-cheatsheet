> Like it or not, English is the dominant language in programming: the syntax of all programming languages is written in English, as well as countless documentations and educational materials. By writing your code in English you dramatically increase its cohesiveness.

## Naming convention

Pick **one** naming convention and follow it. It may be `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `snake_case`, or anything else, as long as it remains consistent. Many programming languages have their own traditions regarding naming conventions; check the documentation for your language or study some popular repositories on Github!
